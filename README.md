A web project which demonstrates my ability to set up a CI/CD pipeline in AWS for a Java web application.

# My Web App Cloud Journey

This project documents my journey of building and deploying a web application in the cloud using AWS and GitHub.  

## What I Did

1️⃣ **Set Up a Web App in the Cloud**  
I got my web application running on AWS, setting up the infrastructure I needed.  

2️⃣ **Connected a GitHub Repo with AWS**  
I linked my GitHub repository with AWS to streamline my workflow and enable CI/CD.  

3️⃣ **Stored Dependencies in CodeArtifact**  
I used AWS CodeArtifact to securely manage and store my project dependencies.  

4️⃣ **Packaged the App with CodeBuild**  
AWS CodeBuild helped me automatically compile and package my application.  

5️⃣ **Deployed the App with CodeDeploy**  
I deployed the packaged application to AWS resources using CodeDeploy.  

⭐️ **Optional: Automated My Infrastructure with CloudFormation**  
I experimented with CloudFormation to define and manage my infrastructure as code.  

7️⃣ **CI/CD with CodePipeline**  
I set up an automated build, test, and deployment pipeline using AWS CodePipeline.

This README reflects my hands-on experience with AWS DevOps services while building a full cloud deployment workflow.
